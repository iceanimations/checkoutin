Description:
=========
When a user pulls a task in a given context within an Asset or shot. My tasks interface should give *him* a starter file in the sandbox. This file should be empty if there is no versions in the context else it should preferably be the latest version in the context.

Scenarios:
========
    Feature: Task File Creation
    In the "My Tasks" interface in Maya
    Create a starter file in sandbox when a user (assignee) pulls in a task

        Scenario: File Creation
            Given I am a user who has been assigned atleast one task
            And I have selected one of my tasks using My Tasks in Maya
            And the selected task context has atleast one version of type maya file associated with it
            And no version is selected
            When I press the button to start executing the selected task
            Then The latest maya file version in the task context should be reproduced in the context folder in the sandbox
            And this Maya File should be loaded in the current Scene

        Scenario: File Creation (version selected)
            Given I am a user who has been assigned atleast one task
            And I have selected one of my tasks using My Tasks in Maya
            And the selected task context has atleast one version of type maya file associated with it
            When I select one of versions in the context
            And I press the button to start executing the selected task
            Then The maya file from the selected version in the task context should be reproduced in the context folder in the sandbox
            And this Maya File should be loaded in the current Scene

        Scenario: First File Creation
            Given I am a user who has been assigned atleast one task
            And I have selected one of my tasks using My Tasks in Maya
            And the selected task context has no versions of type maya files associated with it
            When I press the button to start executing the selected task
            Then A Maya file should be created in the sand box in the context folder
            And this Maya File should be loaded in the current Scene

        Scenario: First File Creation (start animation task from upstream)
            Given I am an animator who has been assigned a task in the context <downstream_context> within a Shot
            But there is no maya file version in the <downstream_context>
            And there is atleast one maya file version in the context <upstream_context> within the same Shot 
            When I press the button to start executing the selected task
            Then The latest maya file version from the task context <upstream_context> should be reproduced in the <downstream_context> folder in the sandbox
            And this Maya File should be loaded in the current Scene

        Scenario Outline: Switch Context ( start animation task with no upstream )
            Given I am an animator who has been assigned a task in the context <downstream_context> within a Shot
            But there is no maya file version in the <downstream_context>
            And there is no maya file version in the context <upstream_context> within the same Shot 
            And I have also been assigned a task in the <upstream_context> within the same shot
            When I press the button to start executing the selected task
            Then the selection of task should switch to one of my tasks in the <upstream_context>

        Scenario Outline: Deny ( start animation task with no upstream )
            Given I am an animator who has been assigned a task in the context <downstream_context> within a Shot
            But there is no maya file version in the <downstream_context>
            And there is no maya file version in the context <upstream_context> within the same Shot 
            And I have not been assigned any task in the <upstream_context> within the same shot
            When I press the button to start executing the selected task
            Then I should be notified that a task in <upstream_context> is pending
            And the Current Scene should not change.

        Examples:
            | downstream_context    | upstream_context |
            | animation/bplus       | layout           |
            | animation/polished    | animation/bplus  |
